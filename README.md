# Data Representation module
## Assignment for Data Representation module requirements:
### 1.Consuming a RESTful API, either in Python (your server) or  javascript (web page) 
### 2.Running a Server.
### 3.Web frontend to display data and interact with server (If the project requires it).


I have managed to create my database and connect through my daos. 
I have created the interface for updating the database(was still working on the create button ..to get ot to flip to create edit mode )
I have created the server (but am a bit unsure )
I have created the config and gitignore files



Things I should have done better:
Checking the server.py earlier, and becoming more comfortable with the virtual environment commands etc .
Also noting better how to import sql connector (spent ages wondering where I had to store it) 
The ID key that I chose as primary key maybe was not such a good idea. I could also get it confused with 'as id'as with find by id would give issues etc..
I was afraid to alter it too much but I should have given it update as was had in the studentdao.

I understand it is bity but I feel the deadline looming and want to get at least this at least in.
